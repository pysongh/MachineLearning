# MachineLearning
Example codes for Machine Learning

ML01 Naive Bayes 
- Bayes rule
- Probability concept for ML
- With Textblob library

ML02 Linear Regression
- Mean Square Error for Cost(loss or Error) function 
- Optimizing by Gradient Descent(Learning rate)
- With Numpy

ML03 SVM (Support Vector Machine)
- Widest Margin Approach
- Decision Boundary(HyperPlane)
- Hinge loss and regularization
- Optimizing by Gradient Descent(Learning rate)
- With Numpy and sklearn.svm

ML04 Neural Network
- Back propagation(Chain rule)
- Mean Square Error for Cost(loss or Error) function 
- Optimizing by Gradient Descent(No Learning rate)
- With Numpy
